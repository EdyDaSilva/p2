<h2>Code Explanation</h2>
<p>The code uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple to-do list application. Here's a brief overview of how it works:</p>
<br>
<ul>
            <li>The HTML file (<code>index.html</code>) contains the structure of the web page, including input fields and buttons.</li>
            <li>The CSS file (<code>styles.css</code>) provides styles and layout for the elements.</li>
            <li>The JavaScript file (<code>script.js</code>) handles the functionality of the to-do list. It includes event listeners for adding, marking, and deleting tasks, as well as functions to update and retrieve tasks from local storage.</li>
        </ul>
